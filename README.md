2 - Metadata Entries: checks if all metadata entries are present in the ZIM file.

3 - Favicon: Checks if the favicon is present in the ZIM file.

4 - Main Page entry: Checks wether the main page is present, and that it points to a valid article.

5 - Redundant data check: Checks if there are any redundant articles.

6 - Internal URL check: checks all interla URLs to make sure that they are valid URLs.

7 - Searching for External Dependencies: The ZIM file is searched for external dependencies.

8 - MIME type check: checks the validity of MIME type of all articles in the ZIM file.
